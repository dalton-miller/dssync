This is a command line utility for backing up your dotfiles to Dropbox.

The main Python script is pre-compiled into bytecode for security reasons,
because if I didn't, people could steal the app key and delete
your backups or access your stuff.

The setup script needs your sudo password to copy it's executable to /usr/bin,
you can look at the script yourself if you'd like.

To install:
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh install

To remove:
./setup.sh remove

To use after install:
ssync help #Shows you everything you need to know
